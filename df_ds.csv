CLINICAL - WHO IS GOING TO GET SICK? WHAT CAN WE DO TO PREVENT OR MITIGATE THESE HEALTH EVENTS? WHEN IS THE BEST TIME TO IMPLEMENT THESE ACTIONS? THIS APPLICATION OF DATA SCIENCE EXAMINES THE DRIVERS OF CLINICAL OUTCOMES; ANALYZES OPPORTUNITIES FOR MANAGING RISK-BASED POPULATIONS; EVALUATES PROGRAMS AND INTERVENTIONS THAT AIM TO IMPROVE PATIENT OUTCOMES.
QUALITY HOW IS QUALITY OF CARE MEASURED AND HOW IS IT RELATED TO PATIENT OUTCOMES? WHERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF CARE TO OUR PATIENTS AND MEMBERS? OUR DATA SCIENTISTS SERVE AS SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS ON HEALTHCARE QUALITY MEASUREMENT AND RISK ADJUSTMENT; USE PREDICTIVE MODELING TO IDENTIFY PATIENT POPULATIONS IN NEED OF CLINICAL INTERVENTIONS; IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT IN CLINICAL PROCESSES THAT CAN LEAD TO IMPROVED QUALITY OF CARE.
OPERATIONAL HOW CAN WE OPTIMIZE OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS IN ORDER TO BE MORE EFFICIENT? HOW DO WE DELIVER OUR SERVICES IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE COORDINATION OF CARE FOR OUR PATIENTS AND MEMBERS? THIS APPLICATION OF DATA SCIENCE FOCUSES ON EFFICIENCY AND OPTIMIZATION OF BUSINESS PRACTICES IN ORDER TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE; USES TECHNIQUES INCLUDING TIME SERIES FORECASTING AND GEOSPATIAL ANALYSIS TO ADDRESS BUSINESS PROBLEMS SUCH AS STAFFING AND SCHEDULING; ANALYZES OPPORTUNITIES FOR BUSINESS GROWTH WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION AND PREDICTS AND FORECASTS EXPENSES.
POLICY WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF HEALTH CARE POLICY ON OUR PATIENT POPULATION? ON OUR MOST VULNERABLE PATIENTS AND MEMBERS? HOW WILL CHANGES IN REIMBURSEMENT POLICY AFFECT THE WAY WE DELIVER PATIENT CARE? WHAT PARTNERSHIPS CAN WE DEVELOP IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT OUR PATIENTS AND MEMBERS CONTINUE RECEIVING OPTIMAL CARE? OUR DATA SCIENTISTS ARE WELL-VERSED IN HEALTHCARE POLICY; ANALYZE AREAS FOR MEANINGFUL VALUE INVESTMENTS THAT FOCUS ON IMPROVING HEALTH OUTCOMES WHILE SAVING MONEY; USE PREDICTIVE MODELING TO IDENTIFY HIGH COST AND HIGH NEED PATIENT POPULATIONS WHO MAY BE IMPACTED MOST BY CHANGES IN HEALTH POLICY.
